# LLM Breakthrough Research Summary (Dec 2025)

## Constitutional Hash: cdd01ef066bc6cf2

## Key Findings for ACGS-2

### 1. Attention/Context: Mamba-2 Hybrid
- Use SSM (linear O(n)) for long documents
- Transformer attention for critical constraints
- JRT-style repetition for constitutional principles

### 2. Self-Verification: External Loop
- VeriPlan: LLM proposes → formal methods verify → iterate
- Accept Gödel incompleteness; design for verification loops
- Proof-carrying governance decisions

### 3. Temporal Consistency: Event Sourcing
- Blockchain-anchored immutable history
- Causal world models for intervention reasoning
- State residuals for reactive replanning

### 4. Edge Cases: Neuro-Symbolic
- DeepProbLog, Abductive Learning architectures
- Symbolic reasoning for edge case handling
- 5% research gap in meta-cognition

### 5. Democratic Governance: Multi-Tier
- Tier 1: <5ms automated (clear cases)
- Tier 2: HITL (ambiguous cases)
- Tier 3: Public deliberation (constitution change)

### 6. Code Verification: Dafny/Z3
- 83% correct code verification
- 92% incorrect code detection
- Saga compensations as formal specs

## Priority Roadmap
P0: Dafny/Z3 for Saga compensations
P1: VeriPlan-style OPA integration
P2: Mamba-2 hybrid for documents
P3: Event sourcing + blockchain
P4: Neuro-symbolic constitutional reasoning
P5: Collective Constitutional AI public input
