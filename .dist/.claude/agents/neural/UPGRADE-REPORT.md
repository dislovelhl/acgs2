| Memory Compression | 60% | (original - compressed) / original |
| Operations/Second | 172,000+ | Throughput benchmark |
| Recall Accuracy | 95%+ | Retrieval test suite |
| Constitutional Compliance | 100% | Hash validation rate |

## Testing Validation

### Structural Validation
- [x] YAML frontmatter valid
- [x] All sections properly formatted
- [x] Code blocks syntax correct
- [x] Tables properly aligned
- [x] Constitutional hash present throughout

### Capability Validation
- [x] Memory architecture patterns complete
- [x] Feedback loop guidance included
- [x] MCP integration examples working
- [x] Self-correction checklists actionable

### Constitutional Validation
- [x] Hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2` included in all operations
- [x] Audit trail requirements documented
- [x] Safety constraints explicitly defined
- [x] Violation handling specified

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected with v2.0.0:

1. Original version preserved at: `.claude/agents/neural/safla-neural.md`
2. Rollback: Simply continue using v1.0.0
3. Enhanced version at: `.claude/agents/neural/safla-neural-v2.md`

## Deployment Recommendation

**Status:** Ready for A/B Testing

**Recommended Rollout:**
1. Alpha: Internal testing (current)
2. Beta: 20% traffic with monitoring
3. Production: Full deployment after 7-day observation

## Success Metrics

After deployment, measure:
- Task completion rate improvement (target: +15%)
- User correction frequency (target: -25%)
- Constitutional compliance (target: 100%)
- Memory operation efficiency (target: +10%)

## Files Changed

- `safla-neural.md` - Preserved (original v1.0.0)
- `safla-neural-v2.md` - Created (enhanced v2.0.0)
- `UPGRADE-REPORT.md` - Created (this document)
