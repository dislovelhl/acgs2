# Gitleaks ignore file
# https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#gitleaksignore
# Use fingerprints from gitleaks findings to ignore specific secrets
#
# IMPORTANT: Each exception must be documented with:
# 1. What the secret is
# 2. Why it's safe to commit
# 3. Mitigation (how production differs)
#
# Review this file periodically to ensure exceptions are still valid

# =============================================================================
# Development SAML Certificates (Self-signed, Testing Only)
# =============================================================================
# These certificates are used ONLY for local development and testing of SAML SSO.
# They are self-signed and NOT trusted by any production IdP.
# Production deployments MUST generate new certificates on deployment.
# See: acgs2-core/shared/auth/certs/README.md
# Fingerprint format: file:rule:line
acgs2-core/shared/auth/certs/sp.key:private-key:1
acgs2-core/shared/auth/certs/sp.crt:certificate:1

# =============================================================================
# Development Environment Configuration (.env.dev)
# =============================================================================
# The .env.dev file contains safe placeholder values for local development.
# These are NOT real secrets and are documented as development-only values.
# Production uses real secrets from a secrets manager (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

# JWT Secret: Development placeholder (clearly marked as "dev-")
# Value: dev-jwt-secret-min-32-chars-required
# Safe because: Obvious placeholder prefix, documented as dev-only
# Production: Uses cryptographically random 64-char hex secret from Vault
.env.dev:jwt-secret-acgs2:23

# Redis Password: Simple development password
# Value: dev_password
# Safe because: Common knowledge dev password, only for local Redis container
# Production: Uses strong randomly generated password from secrets manager
.env.dev:generic-api-key:31

# PostgreSQL MLflow Password: Service-specific development password
# Value: mlflow_password
# Safe because: Only used in local Docker Compose environment
# Production: Uses managed database service with IAM authentication
.env.dev:generic-api-key:53

# =============================================================================
# Known Safe Database Credentials in Example Files
# =============================================================================
# Example files contain placeholder values to guide developers.
# These are never used in production and are clearly marked as examples.

# Policy Marketplace database password placeholder
# Value: acgs2_pass (in connection string)
# Safe because: In .env.example file (excluded by path in .gitleaks.toml)
# Already covered by .gitleaks.toml allowlist pattern 'acgs2_pass'
# acgs2-core/services/policy_marketplace/.env.example:generic-api-key:9

# =============================================================================
# NOTES
# =============================================================================
# 1. Most placeholders are handled by .gitleaks.toml allowlist patterns:
#    - Patterns: dev-*, your-*, <*>, *-example, XXX*, etc.
#    - Paths: *.example files, tests/fixtures/, docs/
#
# 2. This file is for SPECIFIC exceptions that may still trigger detection
#    despite the allowlist patterns.
#
# 3. When adding new exceptions:
#    - Run: gitleaks detect --no-git --verbose
#    - Copy the fingerprint from gitleaks output
#    - Add clear documentation explaining why it's safe
#
# 4. Alternatives to adding fingerprints here:
#    - Update .gitleaks.toml allowlist patterns (preferred for patterns)
#    - Update .gitleaks.toml path exclusions (preferred for entire files)
#    - Fix the actual secret (move to secrets manager)

# Test Scripts with Fake Secrets for E2E Testing
# ==============================================================================
# Test scripts contain intentionally fake secrets for validation purposes
# These are NOT real credentials, generated randomly for testing only

# scripts/test-e2e-secrets-detection.sh - E2E testing script
# Why: Contains fake secrets used to validate secrets detection hooks
# Safe because: Intentionally created fake credentials for testing purposes
# Production: Real secrets managed via Vault/environment variables
