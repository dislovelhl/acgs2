\textbf{Core Contributions:}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt,parsep=2pt,leftmargin=*]
    \item[\textbf{(C1)}] \textbf{System Design and Implementation:} We present the design and implementation of \textbf{ACGS-2}, a distributed microservice architecture for constitutional AI governance comprising \microservices\space services. The system features a cryptographic \textbf{constitutional hash} (\texttt{\constitutionalhash}) ensuring policy consistency across distributed services, and a multi-tier policy-as-code pipeline integrating OPA/Rego with Z3-based formal verification (\Cref{sec:methods}, \Cref{subsec:system_architecture}).

    \item[\textbf{(C2)}] \textbf{Formalization of Constitutional AI:} We formalize constitutional AI as a quadruple $\mathcal{C} = (\mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{E}, \mathcal{V})$ linking principles, reasoning, enforcement, and verification. This formalization provides a rigorous foundation for analyzing constitutional AI systems and their governance properties (\Cref{sec:theoretical_framework}).

    \item[\textbf{(C3)}] \textbf{Democratic Facilitation Capacity (DFC) Metric and Synthetic Constitution Problem:} We introduce \textbf{DFC} as a proposed composite metric for assessing how technical systems preserve deliberation, support stakeholder engagement, enable constitutional evolution, and provide transparency. We also articulate the \textbf{synthetic constitution problem}---the gap between performance on synthetic frameworks and effectiveness under authentic, democratically derived constitutions (\Cref{sec:methodology}, \Cref{sec:discussion}).

    \item[\textbf{(C4)}] \textbf{Reproducible Engineering Evaluation and Gap Analysis:} We provide a reproducible engineering evaluation demonstrating \pnnlatency\space P99 latency, \throughput\space peak throughput, \cachehitrate\space cache hit rate, and \constitutionalcompliance\space constitutional compliance under controlled conditions. We discuss the \textbf{laboratory-to-production gap}, identifying factors that affect real-world deployment (\Cref{sec:validation}, \Cref{sec:discussion}).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Positioning:} ACGS-2 is a \textit{prototype constitutional AI governance infrastructure}---a reproducible systems and methodology case study exploring the lab-to-production gap. We do not claim to solve democratic governance; we provide infrastructure and methodology, not a normative solution to constitutional design or democratic legitimacy.
