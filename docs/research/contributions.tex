    \item We expose the fundamental tension between technical optimization and democratic governance, demonstrating through synthetic scenario analysis that high-performance automation (\throughput, \pnnlatency\space P99 latency in controlled testing) must be balanced against the deliberative processes essential to constitutional legitimacy. Real-world deployments would require extensive stakeholder engagement (estimated months based on governance literature) (\Cref{sec:discussion}). Constitutional hash verification ensures governance consistency across distributed services.
    \item We provide theoretical analysis of the anticipated laboratory-to-production gap in constitutional governance, identifying temporal mismatches between automated decisions and stakeholder engagement requirements across simulated sector scenarios (healthcare, finance, education, government) (\Cref{sec:deployment_example}). Development-environment validation demonstrates system capabilities while acknowledging real-world deployment remains future work.
    \item We develop a methodological framework (Democratic Facilitation Capacity) for evaluating constitutional AI systems based on their capacity to support democratic processes rather than on technical performance alone. This proposed methodology shifts focus from compliance metrics to deliberation preservation and stakeholder facilitation (\Cref{sec:comparative_analysis}), though empirical validation with authentic stakeholders remains essential future work.
    \item We offer ACGS-2 as a prototype reference implementation and critical case study. We provide open-source infrastructure built on established distributed systems techniques, alongside honest analysis of what automated constitutional governance can and cannot accomplish (\Cref{subsec:system_architecture}, \Cref{sec:qec_sft}). Constitutional hash enforcement (\texttt{cdd01ef066bc6cf2}) demonstrates cryptographic governance consistency in development environments.
