ACGS-2: Autonomous Constitutional Governance System v2

A production-ready cognitive architecture for safe, scalable AI systems.

This package implements the complete ACGS-2 architecture as specified in the
architecture manifest, providing:

- Layered safety with constitutional AI constraints
- Stateful session management with provenance tracking
- Tool mediation with sandboxed execution
- Distributed memory with RAG capabilities
- Orchestration with checkpointing and resumption
- Enterprise-grade observability and audit trails

The architecture supports incremental deployment starting with Flow A
(UIG → SAS → CRE → TMS → DMS) as the core cognitive loop.
