### Design Documents
Located in `../design/` subdirectory:
- Pillar designs and architectural components

## Usage

### For Architects
- Review ADRs for historical context on major decisions
- Use production blueprint for strategic planning
- Reference architecture diagrams for system understanding

### For Developers
- Consult workflow patterns for implementation guidance
- Review integration documentation for API usage
- Use governance lifecycle for compliance requirements

### For Product Managers
- Review GTM strategy for market positioning
- Use commercial roadmap for release planning
- Reference system summary for stakeholder communications

## Constitutional Compliance

**Constitutional Hash**: `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`

All architectural decisions and documentation must maintain constitutional governance and compliance requirements.

## Maintenance

### Document Updates
- Review strategic documents quarterly
- Update architecture diagrams with system changes
- Maintain ADR log for new architectural decisions

### Version Control
- Architecture documents follow semantic versioning
- Major architectural changes require ADR documentation
- All changes reviewed by architecture team
