## 🔮 Analysis Insights

### Key Findings
1. **Violation Rate vs Satisfaction Trade-off:** Stricter thresholds catch more issues but reduce developer satisfaction
2. **Maintenance Cost Impact:** High-severity violations significantly increase long-term maintenance costs
3. **Implementation Effort:** Moderate thresholds offer best balance of quality enforcement and practical deployment

### Recommendations
- Start with recommended thresholds and monitor for 2 weeks
- Adjust based on team feedback and actual violation patterns
- Consider gradual tightening of thresholds over time
- Implement automated fixes for common violation types
