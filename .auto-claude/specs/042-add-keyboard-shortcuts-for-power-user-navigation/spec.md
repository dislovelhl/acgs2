# Add Keyboard Shortcuts for Power User Navigation

## Overview

Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions: Enter to submit query, Escape to clear, and R to refresh the currently focused widget.

## Rationale

Enterprise users often prefer keyboard shortcuts for efficiency. The query interface supports Enter to submit (via form), but lacks other shortcuts. Power users managing governance dashboards would benefit from quick keyboard access to refresh and clear actions.
