# Add Skip-to-Main-Content Link for Keyboard Navigation

## Overview

Implement a skip-link that appears on keyboard focus, allowing users to bypass the header and navigate directly to the main dashboard content.

## Rationale

Keyboard users and screen reader users must tab through the entire header before reaching the main content. A skip link is a fundamental accessibility requirement that improves navigation efficiency for users who rely on keyboard navigation.
