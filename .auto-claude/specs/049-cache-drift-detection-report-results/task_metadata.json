  "rationale": "Drift detection is called periodically (every 5 minutes by default) and involves expensive operations: DataFrame creation from deques, statistical test execution (K-S, PSI tests). In high-traffic scenarios targeting 10,000+ RPS, these computations add unnecessary CPU overhead when reference/current windows haven't changed significantly.",
