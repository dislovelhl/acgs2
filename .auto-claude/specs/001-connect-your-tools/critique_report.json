  "critique_summary": "Spec was well-structured and comprehensive, but had critical accuracy issues with package versions and a missing verification warning. Research findings specified gql>=3.5.0 and python-gitlab>=4.4.0, but spec used older versions (3.0.0 and 4.0.0). Most importantly, research explicitly marked all information as 'REQUIRES_VERIFICATION' but spec did not warn implementers about this. Fixed all version mismatches, added prominent verification warning in Overview, added Linear GraphQL initialization code example, and updated implementation plan to prioritize verification steps.",

    "Test webhook signature verification methods against official docs - security implementations may have evolved",
    "Consider adding rate limit specifics once verified (research notes Linear's rate limits weren't specified)",
    "When implementing, start with package verification as specified in updated Phase 1, before writing any integration code"
