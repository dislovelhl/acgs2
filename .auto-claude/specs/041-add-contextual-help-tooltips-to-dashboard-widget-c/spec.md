# Add Contextual Help Tooltips to Dashboard Widget Controls

## Overview

Add informative tooltips to widget control buttons that explain their functionality, especially for the Lock/Unlock and Reset Layout features.

## Rationale

The dashboard has specialized controls (Lock layout, Reset layout, Drag handle) that may not be immediately obvious to new users. While there's a 'Drag widgets to rearrange' hint, other controls lack explanatory context.
