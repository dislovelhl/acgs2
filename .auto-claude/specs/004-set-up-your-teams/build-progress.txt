=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: ACGS2 (AI-driven Compliance Governance System v2)
Spec: 004-set-up-your-teams
Workspace: [managed by orchestrator]
Started: 2026-01-03T21:30:00Z

Workflow Type: simple (administrative task - no code changes)
Rationale: This is a non-technical administrative task for configuring teams in Linear's project management platform. It requires no code changes to the ACGS2 monorepo. The 'simple' workflow is appropriate because this is a single-service (Linear platform) task with minimal overhead and no code implementation required.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 3
- Total subtasks: 5
- Created init.sh
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:
- Phase 1 (Documentation Review): 3 subtasks, no dependencies
  Purpose: Review Linear's documentation on workspaces, teams, and member management

- Phase 2 (Workspace Verification): 1 subtask, depends on Phase 1
  Purpose: Check the current state of the Linear workspace to determine if teams and members are already configured

- Phase 3 (Task Completion): 1 subtask, depends on Phase 2
  Purpose: Complete the Linear issue based on workspace verification results

Services Involved:
- None - This task operates entirely within Linear's platform
- No ACGS2 services require modifications

Codebase Changes:
- None required
- This is an administrative task with no code implementation

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 1
- Recommended workers: 1
- Parallel groups: None (sequential administrative workflow)
- Speedup estimate: N/A - sequential administrative workflow

Verification Strategy:
- Risk Level: trivial
- Skip Validation: true
- Test Types Required: None (administrative verification only)
- Security Scanning: Not required
- Staging Deployment: Not required

Reasoning: Administrative task with no code changes - trivial risk level, validation skipped

QA Acceptance:
- Unit Tests: Not required
- Integration Tests: Not required
- E2E Tests: Not required
- Browser Verification: Not required
- Database Verification: Not required
- Administrative Verification: Required
  ✓ Linear workspace is accessible
  ✓ Teams are configured (if needed)
  ✓ Members are invited (if needed)
  ✓ Linear issue XN-2 is marked as complete

=== CRITICAL NOTES ===

⚠️  This is NOT a development task - it's an administrative task
⚠️  NO CODE CHANGES should be made to the ACGS2 codebase
⚠️  NO SERVICES need to be started
⚠️  All actions take place in Linear's platform (linear.app)

Task Completion Options:
1. If teams are already configured → Mark Linear issue XN-2 as complete
2. If teams need setup → Follow Linear docs, invite members, then mark complete
3. If not applicable (solo project) → Close Linear issue as "Won't Do"

- Teams: https://linear.app/docs/teams
- Invite Members: https://linear.app/docs/invite-members
- Settings: http://linear.app/settings/members

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

To continue with this administrative task, run:

  source auto-claude/.venv/bin/activate && python auto-claude/run.py --spec 004 --parallel 1

Note: The implementation agent will NOT write any code. It will guide you through:
  1. Reviewing Linear documentation
  2. Verifying your Linear workspace configuration
  3. Marking the Linear issue as complete

=== END SESSION 1 ===

Status: Planning completed
Next: Implementation agent will guide administrative verification
Expected Duration: 10-15 minutes (manual review)
