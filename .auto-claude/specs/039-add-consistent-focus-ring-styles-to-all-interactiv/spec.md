# Add Consistent Focus Ring Styles to All Interactive Elements

## Overview

Apply visible and consistent focus indicator styles to all buttons in the dashboard widgets, not just the query input field.

## Rationale

Currently only the query input has visible focus styles (focus:border-indigo-500 focus:ring-1). Widget buttons lack visible focus indicators, making keyboard navigation difficult as users cannot tell which element is currently focused.
