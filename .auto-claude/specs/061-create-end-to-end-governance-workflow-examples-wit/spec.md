# Create end-to-end governance workflow examples with working code

## Overview

While the README and getting-started guide explain concepts, there's no comprehensive example showing a complete governance workflow from policy creation through enforcement to audit logging. The examples/ directory is referenced but lacks walkthrough examples for the core ACGS-2 use cases.

## Rationale

The target audience of 'Enterprise DevOps/MLOps engineers deploying AI systems' needs practical examples showing how to integrate ACGS-2 into their existing workflows. Current documentation explains what ACGS-2 does but not how to use it for real-world scenarios like: defining a constitutional policy, enforcing it on agent actions, handling HITL approvals, and auditing decisions.
