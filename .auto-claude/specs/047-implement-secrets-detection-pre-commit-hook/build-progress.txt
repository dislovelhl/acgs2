# Build Progress - Implement Secrets Detection Pre-commit Hook

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Analysis and Setup (In Progress)

### Completed Subtasks:

#### ✅ Subtask 1.1 - Analyze existing gitleaks configuration (2026-01-03)
- Reviewed `.gitleaksignore` - currently contains only 1 ignored secret (SAML dev cert)
- Analyzed GitHub workflow `reusable-security.yml` - uses gitleaks-action@v2 in CI
- Examined current pre-commit config - no gitleaks hook present
- Reviewed secrets_manager.py CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS
- Created comprehensive analysis document: `gitleaks-analysis.md`

**Key Findings:**
- Gitleaks is operational in CI but NOT in pre-commit hooks
- Minimal .gitleaksignore with only development SAML certificate exception
- Gap between runtime validation (secrets_manager.py) and commit-time prevention
- Need custom rules for ACGS-2 specific patterns (Anthropic, OpenRouter, HuggingFace)
- Placeholder detection critical to avoid false positives

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Documented list of currently ignored secrets (1 item)
- ✅ Understanding of gitleaks configuration in CI
- ✅ List of file patterns that need secret scanning

---

#### ✅ Subtask 1.2 - Review secrets_manager.py patterns (2026-01-03)
- Extracted all 8 CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS with detailed regex analysis
- Identified 7 additional secrets in SECRET_CATEGORIES without defined patterns
- Analyzed valid vs invalid secret format criteria with examples
- Documented 5 categories of placeholder patterns observed in codebase
- Created comprehensive detection logic for placeholder vs real secrets
- Mapped patterns to gitleaks rule requirements
- Created detailed analysis document: `secrets-patterns-analysis.md`

**Key Findings:**
- 8 of 15 secrets have strict validation patterns for precise detection
- AI provider keys (Anthropic, OpenRouter, Claude Code) need custom gitleaks rules
- Placeholder patterns consistently use `dev-*`, `your-*`, `<...>` format
- .env.dev uses safe development placeholders like `dev-jwt-secret-min-32-chars-required`
- 7 secrets without patterns require gitleaks generic rule coverage

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ List of all credential patterns from secrets_manager.py (8 patterns documented)
- ✅ Understanding of what constitutes valid vs invalid secret format
- ✅ Identification of placeholder vs real secrets (5 placeholder categories)

---

#### ✅ Subtask 1.3 - Design hook strategy (2026-01-03)
- Designed multi-layered defense-in-depth approach: gitleaks + custom ACGS-2 hook
- Documented comprehensive file scanning vs exclusion strategy
- Defined performance optimization strategies with <5s target
- Created detailed hook execution flow and integration plan
- Specified three-tier allow-list system (pattern/path/fingerprint-based)
- Designed context-aware validation by file type
- Planned phased rollout with success metrics
- Created detailed strategy document: `hook-strategy.md`

**Key Decisions:**
- Layer 1: Gitleaks for broad industry-standard detection (140+ rules)
- Layer 2: Custom hook using CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS from secrets_manager.py
- Single source of truth: import patterns directly from secrets_manager.py
- Performance target: <5s for typical commits via staged-files-only scanning
- Error messages: actionable with clear remediation steps
- Allow-list strategy: pattern-based (broad), path-based (targeted), fingerprint-based (precise)

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ Documented hook strategy with rationale (multi-layered architecture)
- ✅ List of files/patterns to scan vs exclude (comprehensive categorization)
- ✅ Performance considerations documented (6 optimization strategies, metrics)

### Pending Subtasks:

None - Phase 1 Complete! Ready for Phase 2.

---

## Next Steps:
1. Proceed to Phase 2 - Gitleaks Pre-commit Integration
2. Implement subtask 2.1: Add gitleaks to pre-commit config
3. Create .gitleaks.toml with ACGS-2 specific rules

## Blockers:
None
