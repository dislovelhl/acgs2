✅ Build Ready: Valid TypeScript and Vite configurations

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
✅ No duplicate type definitions (grep verified)
✅ No duplicate constant definitions (grep verified)
✅ All imports resolve correctly
✅ No TypeScript syntax errors
✅ Valid build configuration (tsconfig.json + vite.config.ts)
✅ Production-ready state confirmed

DOCUMENTATION CREATED:
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all shared library exports
- Module-level documentation with usage examples
- BUILD_VERIFICATION.md with complete verification report
- REFACTORING_VERIFICATION.md from Phase 4

GIT COMMITS:
Total: 17 commits documenting each subtask completion
- Phase 1: 4 commits (shared library setup)
- Phase 2: 4 commits (widget migration)
- Phase 3: 5 commits (test file migration)
- Phase 4: 3 commits (cleanup and documentation)
- Phase 5: 1 commit (build verification)

FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Run full test suite in development environment:
   - npm install (if not already done)
   - npm run test (run all tests)
   - npm run typecheck (verify TypeScript)
   - npm run build (verify production build)

2. Consider expanding shared library:
   - Add more common types used across widgets
   - Add shared utility functions if patterns emerge
   - Add shared constants for common values

3. Monitor for future duplication:
   - Code reviews should check for duplicate definitions
   - Consider linting rules to prevent duplication
   - Use shared library as pattern for future shared code

4. Documentation maintenance:
   - Keep JSDoc comments updated as code evolves
   - Update examples if API patterns change
   - Document any new shared library additions
