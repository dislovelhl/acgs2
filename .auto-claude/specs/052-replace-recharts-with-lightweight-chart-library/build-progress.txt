=== BUILD PROGRESS ===
Feature: Replace recharts with Lightweight Chart Library
Spec: 052-replace-recharts-with-lightweight-chart-library
Status: Planning Complete

=== IMPLEMENTATION PLAN CREATED ===
Date: 2026-01-03
Plan Status: Complete

=== OVERVIEW ===
This feature aims to replace recharts (~500KB unparsed, ~150KB gzipped) with a lightweight
charting library to significantly reduce bundle size and improve dashboard performance.

Current recharts usage identified in:
1. analytics-dashboard/src/components/widgets/PredictionWidget.tsx
   - Uses ComposedChart with Area (confidence intervals) and Line charts
   - Custom tooltip implementation
   - Responsive container

2. acgs2-observability/monitoring/dashboard/src/components/MetricsChart.tsx
   - Uses LineChart with multiple series (CPU, Memory, Disk)
   - Lazy-loaded recharts components
   - Custom tooltip styling

=== IMPLEMENTATION PHASES ===

Phase 1: Research & Library Selection (4 subtasks)
- Analyze current usage patterns
- Research alternatives (visx, uPlot, lightweight-charts)
- Create proof-of-concept implementations
- Select final library based on bundle size, API, TypeScript support

Phase 2: Analytics Dashboard Migration (6 subtasks)
- Install selected library
- Create reusable chart wrapper components
- Migrate PredictionWidget
- Update tests
- Verify functionality

Phase 3: Observability Dashboard Migration (5 subtasks)
- Install selected library
- Create/copy chart wrappers
- Migrate MetricsChart
- Update/create tests
- Verify functionality

Phase 4: Cleanup & Verification (7 subtasks)
- Remove recharts dependencies
- Bundle analysis and size verification
- Search for remaining references
- Update documentation
- Full test suite verification
- Create migration summary report

=== SUCCESS CRITERIA ===
✓ recharts removed from both dashboards
✓ All charts render correctly with new library
✓ All tests pass
✓ Bundle size reduced by at least 100KB (gzipped)
✓ No visual or functional regressions
✓ Documentation updated
✓ Bundle analysis report completed

=== NEXT STEPS ===
1. Start Phase 1: Research lightweight charting alternatives
2. Evaluate visx, uPlot, and lightweight-charts for feature parity
3. Create proof-of-concept for PredictionWidget
4. Make library selection based on bundle size and API ergonomics

=== NOTES ===
- Focus on maintaining visual consistency throughout migration
- Ensure all current features are supported: multi-line charts, area charts,
  confidence intervals, custom tooltips, responsive layouts
- Both dashboards use React 18, TypeScript, and Vite
- Existing tests mock recharts - will need similar mocking approach for new library
- The MetricsChart already has lazy loading optimization which may be adapted

End of Initial Planning

=== PHASE 1: RESEARCH & LIBRARY SELECTION ===

[COMPLETED] Subtask 1.1: Analyze current recharts usage patterns
Date: 2026-01-03
Duration: ~30 minutes

What was done:
- Analyzed PredictionWidget.tsx (548 lines) in analytics-dashboard
- Analyzed MetricsChart.tsx (263 lines) in observability dashboard
- Reviewed test files and mocking strategies
- Documented all recharts imports and component usage
- Created comprehensive analysis document: recharts-usage-analysis.md

Key Findings:

1. PredictionWidget (Analytics Dashboard):
   - Uses ComposedChart with 4 overlaid series:
     * 1x Area chart (confidence interval with gradient)
     * 3x Line charts (lower bound, upper bound, predicted - 2 dashed, 1 solid)
   - Custom tooltip component with Tailwind styling
   - SVG gradient definitions for area fills
   - Purple color theme (#7C3AED, #8B5CF6, #C4B5FD)
   - Animations disabled
   - Data format includes tuple for confidenceRange: [lower, upper]
   - Migration Complexity: MEDIUM-HIGH

2. MetricsChart (Observability Dashboard):
   - Uses simple LineChart with 3 series (CPU, Memory, Disk)
   - All recharts components lazy-loaded with React.lazy()
   - Standard tooltip with custom styling
   - CartesianGrid with dashed pattern
   - Fixed Y-axis domain [0, 100] for percentages
   - Blue/Purple/Orange color scheme
   - Component heavily optimized (React.memo, useMemo)
   - Migration Complexity: LOW-MEDIUM

3. Testing:
   - Both use Vitest for testing
   - Recharts components mocked in tests
   - Tests use data-testid attributes to verify chart rendering

4. Bundle Impact:
   - Current recharts: ~500KB unparsed, ~150KB gzipped
   - Lazy loading only used in MetricsChart
   - PredictionWidget eagerly imports all components

Feature Requirements Identified:
✓ ComposedChart capability (overlay Area + multiple Lines)
✓ Multi-series line charts
✓ Custom React tooltips
✓ SVG gradient support
✓ Dashed stroke patterns
✓ Custom axis formatters
✓ Responsive container
✓ Hover interactions (active dots)
✓ Animation control (disable)
✓ TypeScript support
✓ React 18 compatibility
✓ Lazy loading support

- visx: ~40KB gzipped (73% reduction) ✅
- uPlot: ~12KB gzipped (92% reduction) ⚠️ Feature limitations
- lightweight-charts: ~13KB gzipped (91% reduction) ⚠️ Feature compromises

Feature Parity:
- visx: ✅ 100% feature parity (perfect match)
- uPlot: ❌ Cannot render confidence interval area band (CRITICAL)
- lightweight-charts: ⚠️ Approximations needed for area bands

React Integration:
- visx: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ First-class React, declarative API
- uPlot: ⭐⭐⭐ Needs wrapper, imperative API
- lightweight-charts: ⭐⭐ Needs wrapper, imperative API

Code Complexity:
- visx: Medium (~200 lines chart code) - More code but cleaner
- uPlot: Medium (~150 lines) - Less code but feature limitations
- lightweight-charts: Medium (~180 lines) - Approximations needed

Visual Fidelity:
- visx: ✅ Exact match to recharts (gradients, tooltips, styling)
- uPlot: ❌ Cannot replicate gradient confidence interval
- lightweight-charts: ⚠️ Area chart is approximate (midpoint, not band)

FINAL RECOMMENDATION: **visx** 🏆

Rationale:
✅ 100% feature parity with recharts
✅ 75% bundle size reduction (150KB → 40KB) - Excellent savings
✅ Perfect visual fidelity (SVG gradients, custom tooltips, exact styling)
✅ React-first declarative API
✅ Native TypeScript with excellent type inference
✅ Low migration risk (proven approach, good documentation)
✅ Suitable for both PredictionWidget (complex) and MetricsChart (simple)
✅ Active maintenance by Airbnb

Why NOT uPlot:
❌ Cannot properly render confidence interval area band (CRITICAL limitation)
❌ No SVG gradients (canvas-based)
⚠️ Best for simple line charts only (good for MetricsChart, NOT PredictionWidget)

Why NOT lightweight-charts:
❌ Wrong use case (financial charts, not general data visualization)
⚠️ Cannot properly render area bands (approximations needed)
⚠️ Imperative API, not React-friendly

Hybrid Approach Evaluated and REJECTED:
- Considered: visx for PredictionWidget + uPlot for MetricsChart
- Bundle: ~52KB (vs ~40KB visx-only)
- Savings: Additional 13KB
- Decision: NOT worth the complexity of maintaining two libraries
- Recommendation: Use visx for both components (simpler, consistent)
