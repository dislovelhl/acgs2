Here's my assessment:\n\n### **Key Finding: This is a NON-DEVELOPMENT Task**\n\nThis Linear issue (XN-1) is an **onboarding/educational task**, not a code implementation task. It asks the user to:\n- Watch an introductory video about Linear\n- Read setup documentation based on company stage\n- Access support resources (Slack community, live sessions)\n\n### **Assessment Summary**\n\n- **Complexity**: `simple` (technically, but this shouldn't go through development workflow)\n- **Workflow Type**: `simple` (not a feature/refactor/migration)\n- **Confidence**: `1.0` (100% certain this is non-development work)\n- **Files to Modify**: `0`\n- **Services Involved**: `0`\n- **External Integrations**: `None`\n\n### **Validation Recommendations**\n\n- **Risk Level**: `trivial`\n- **Skip Validation**: `true` (no code to test)\n- **Test Types**: None required\n- **Security Scan**: Not needed\n- **Staging Deployment**: Not applicable\n\n### **Recommended Action**\n\nThe assessment flags this as a **NON_DEVELOPMENT_TASK** with the recommendation for **MANUAL_COMPLETION**. The orchestrator should recognize this and either:\n1. Skip the implementation pipeline entirely\n2. Simply mark the Linear issue as complete after user acknowledges they've reviewed the onboarding resources\n3. Provide user guidance to manually complete the onboarding steps\n\n### **User Guidance**\n\nTo complete this task manually:\n1. Watch the [LinearH264Version.mp4](https://uploads.linear.app/fe63b3e2-bf87-46c0-8784-cd7d639287c8/923e2801-e5f2-4055-9b27-1541f27e3365/44ab081a-253a-4ccf-8d3d-2547ac09b986) video\n2. Choose a setup guide based on your company stage (small/mid/large)\n3. Review the selected documentation\n4. Optionally join the Slack community or live onboarding session\n5. Mark Linear issue XN-1 as complete\n\n**The complexity assessment file is ready for the orchestrator to process.**",
