**Tasks:**
1. Run comprehensive performance benchmarks
2. Validate P99 latency ≤ 0.328ms
3. Validate throughput ≥ 2,605 RPS
4. Check cache hit rates
5. Monitor constitutional compliance overhead
6. Generate performance report

**Success Criteria:**
- P99 latency: ≤ 0.328ms (target: <5ms)
- Throughput: ≥ 2,605 RPS (target: >100 RPS)
- Cache hit rate: ≥ 95% (target: >85%)
- Constitutional overhead: <10% of total latency

**Dependencies:** Swarm 4 completion

---

### Swarm 6: Constitutional Compliance Audit (CONTROLLER role)
**Agent**: constitutional-auditor
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Duration**: 5-10 minutes

**Tasks:**
1. Validate constitutional hash (cdd01ef066bc6cf2) across all modules
2. Audit MACI role assignments and enforcement
3. Check blockchain governance anchoring
4. Validate audit trail integrity
5. Review security headers and PII redaction
6. Generate compliance report

**Success Criteria:**
- Constitutional hash validated: 100%
- MACI enforcement: No violations
- Audit trails: Complete and immutable
- Security: All headers present

**Dependencies:** All previous swarms (final validation)

---

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Execution (Parallel)
**Swarms:** 1 (no dependencies)
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes

### Phase 2: Post-Commit Validation (Parallel)
**Swarms:** 2, 3 (depend on Swarm 1)
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

### Phase 3: Integration Testing (Sequential)
**Swarms:** 4 (depends on Swarm 2)
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

### Phase 4: Final Validation (Sequential)
**Swarms:** 5, 6 (depends on Swarm 4)
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes

### Total Estimated Duration
**Best Case:** 35 minutes (parallel execution optimized)
**Worst Case:** 60 minutes (with error remediation)

## MACI Role Assignments

| Swarm | Agent ID | MACI Role | Permissions |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | workflow-consolidator | EXECUTIVE | PROPOSE, SYNTHESIZE, QUERY |
| 2 | test-validator | JUDICIAL | VALIDATE, AUDIT, QUERY |
| 3 | docs-updater | LEGISLATIVE | EXTRACT_RULES, SYNTHESIZE, QUERY |
| 4 | integration-validator | MONITOR | MONITOR_ACTIVITY, QUERY |
| 5 | performance-auditor | AUDITOR | AUDIT, QUERY |
| 6 | constitutional-auditor | CONTROLLER | ENFORCE_CONTROL, QUERY |

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Test failures**: Swarm 2 may discover regressions
   - Mitigation: Immediate debugging agent spawned
   - Rollback: Git revert if critical

2. **Performance degradation**: Swarm 5 may detect performance issues
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize hot paths
   - Escalation: Performance engineer notification

### Medium Risks
1. **Integration failures**: Swarm 4 may find broken integrations
   - Mitigation: Service-specific debugging
   - Fallback: Temporary service bypass

### Low Risks
1. **Documentation issues**: Swarm 3 may find outdated docs
   - Mitigation: Update in-place
   - Impact: Non-blocking

## Monitoring and Reporting

**Real-time Monitoring:**
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Grafana dashboard updates
- PagerDuty alerting (if issues)
- Constitutional compliance tracking

**Final Report Includes:**
- Task completion status
- Performance benchmarks
- Test coverage statistics
- Constitutional compliance audit
- Integration validation results
- Recommendations for next phase

---

## Constitutional Compliance

All swarm operations must:
1. Validate against constitutional hash `cdd01ef066bc6cf2`
2. Enforce MACI role separation
3. Maintain audit trails
4. Preserve blockchain governance anchoring
5. Pass constitutional validation gates

**Compliance Gates:**
- Pre-execution: Constitutional hash validation
- During execution: MACI role enforcement
- Post-execution: Audit trail verification
- Final validation: Complete compliance audit

---

## Next Steps After Completion

1. **Code Review**: Human review of workflow changes
2. **Deployment**: Consider deployment to staging/production
3. **Monitoring**: 24-hour monitoring period
4. **Phase 10**: Begin "Enterprise Integration & Migration" work
5. **Documentation**: Update roadmap with completion status
